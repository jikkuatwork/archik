# 🏰 Archik

**Built with Gemini 3.0** | *The effortless way to dream up spaces.*

---

Welcome to **Archik**, a fun side project born from the desire to make drawing floor plans as easy as doodling on a napkin—but with superpowers.

Forget complex CAD tools that require a PhD to operate. Archik is about **flow**. You draw a line, it becomes a wall. You click a wall, it gets a window. You share a link, and your friend sees your masterpiece instantly. 

It's effortless, it's instant, and it's surprisingly powerful.

## ✨ Features that Spark Joy

*   **⚡ Lightning Fast Drawing**: Click to start, click to end. Snapping happens automatically. It feels like magic.
*   **🧊 Instant 3D**: Watch your 2D sketch rise into a beautiful 3D model in real-time. No rendering times, no waiting.
*   **🖱️ Smart Context Menu**: Select a wall, and the tools appear right next to your cursor. Add windows or doors without hunting through menus.
*   **📐 Infinite Canvas**: Pan with two fingers (or scroll wheel) and drag your plan anywhere. There are no boundaries to your creativity.
*   **🪄 URL Sharing**: Send your entire floor plan to a friend just by copying the URL. We use some serious compression wizardry to fit your house in a link.
*   **💾 JSON Export/Import**: Want to save your work for later? Download it as a JSON file and load it back up whenever inspiration strikes.
*   **📦 Box Selection**: Drag a box to select multiple walls and delete them all at once. Satisfyingly destructive.
