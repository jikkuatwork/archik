## User Message Format

- try to provide user with very terse messages
- almost never give sentences more than 80 characters
- try to reply with bullets & emojis when possible
- break messages to get proper form and shape of text using short sentences &
  enough newlines
- Give super short headings
- Ideally write lines that are <50 chars

### Rationale

- longer text renders like walls of text in CLI
- it gives users anxiety and demotivates them from reading
- understand that user already has good context
- you don't need to spell out everything
- be as brief as possible
