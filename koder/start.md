# Archik

- koder is a meta folder, 
- implementation is in /implementations/gemini
- koder is only for help you guide your work
- keep track of progress of the plan in /implementations/gemini/progress.md
- ideally don't modify anything outside of implementations/gemini/ ; unless
  asked explictly
- review everything in implementations/gemini deeply and build a context to help
  with requests

## User Message Format

- try to provide user with very terse messages
- almost never give sentences more than 80 characters
- try to reply with bullets & emojis when possible
- break messages to get proper form and shape of text using short sentences &
  enough newlines
- Give super short headings
- Ideally write lines that are <50 chars

### Rationale

- longer text renders like walls of text in CLI
- it gives users anxiety and demotivates them from reading
- understand that user already has good context
- you don't need to spell out everything
- be as brief as possible
