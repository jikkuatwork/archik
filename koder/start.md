# Archik

- koder is a meta folder, 
- implementation is in /implementations/gemini
- koder is only for help you guide your work
- keep track of progress of the plan in /implementations/gemini/progress.md
- ideally don't modify anything outside of implementations/gemini/ ; unless
  asked explictly
- review everything in implementations/gemini deeply and build a context to help
  with requests
