# Archik Philosophy

- super simple to learn
- minimal primitives to learn
- extensible but core system has no customization for visual variety
- rigidity ~= simplicity
- learnable in <10m
- 100% JSON representable plans
- open source, frontend alone

## Polygon Edge Primitive

- The system is built around this polygon edge primitive
- draw a poygon, apply modifiers to edges
- this simple primitive enabled us doors/windows for walls and railings with
  gates to floors
- I think we can do more with this

## Thoughts

- perhaps we have to invent few more primitives before we are able to build
  proper plans
- but I don't want to add more if this can be extended
- i want least number of primitives to learn
- i am not in the game of delivering the most high fidelity plan, but a useful
  plan in very short amount of time
- i want to find clever, low hanging fruits to build a tool that solves 95% of
  the problems; than bloating it to achieve 100%
