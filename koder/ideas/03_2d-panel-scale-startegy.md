# Scale startegy

- i need a different way to scale the 2d-panel
- now zoom in/out zooms the nodes & edges
- thats jarring for me
- i feel the edges and nodes' sizes should be scale invariant
- so that the effective area of the floor plan zooms, but the edges & nodes
  remain the same size in every scale
- clarification: size of edge = stroke width; stroke length should obviously be
  scaled
- this is analogous to the scale/selection/rotation controls in figma; at
  whatever zoom level the control handles remains the same.
- forget how  to implement this for now, just think about it
- is it sensible? Or does the nodes/edges scale proportionally?
