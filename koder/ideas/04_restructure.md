# Restructure / Refactor

- we have been building this project in a very quick & dirty manner
- but this style won't scale
- i want to Restructure/Refactor the project for better maintainability

i am thinking something like this:

```
ui-windower/
artboard/ (2d panel)
  panels/ (controls)
  primitives/
    lines
plugins/
  three-d-view
    library/
      standard/
        door
        window
        stair
        counter
        railings
```
