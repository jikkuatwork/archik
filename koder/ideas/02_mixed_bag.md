# Mixed Bag of Ideas

1. Zoom in/out for 2d panel

- not sure whats the ideal way to do it
  - zoom slider?
  - +/- zoom?
  - shift + drag?
  - match the zoom system in 3d panel & change the selection rectangle to shift
    + drag?

2. Full State Save

- can we save the total UI state in the import/export file?
- the file can avoid it, then default will be taken, but if not it can
  initialise the zoom, rotation, theme etc?

3. Project meta

- can we have a system to manage project meta?
- say title, subtitle, author, tags?

4. Versions

- can we implement versions, so that I can save version and it will be shown in
  versions? with label, timestamp?
- so loading and unloading from versions will be possible?

5. Can we have multiple doors/windows

- but not in interface edit interface; but just have the ability so that someone
  else will be able to build different ones for different frontend
- so we will standardize the size of doors/windows and will have a standard
  implementation but for a different viewer they can use different doors/windows
  with the same dimensions but different styles
- perhaps we need to mention the asset-id in the format for doing this?
